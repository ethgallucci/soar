### For Cosmos Blockchains

### advisory
This is a simple weekend project I wanted to build to further learn what you can query about a CosmosSDK chain over RPC, and why it can be useful for gathering information. This is not a full-fledged project of mine, as I'm still wrapping up the Fall semester and have been a bit too busy with finals to build this into something like a full Rust fork of [strangelove-ventures](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures)' [lens](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/lens).


## v0.1.3
Adds support for evmos, implements unit-tests

## Roadmap
* Allow endpoints to be determined by the user instead of relying on a single node to maintain constant uptime.
* Integrate suppport for all other CosmosSDK-based chains.
* Write unit-tests for all new chains added to soar-rpc.
